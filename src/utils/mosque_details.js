    description: `We started in the late 1980's to investigate the possibility of establishing a Masjid in the West End of Ottawa to serve the needs of the growing Muslim Community. The idea was to serve the residents of Bayshore, Greenbank - Baseline - Craig Henry corridor, Barrhaven, Bells Corners and Kanata.

    In late 1988, a meeting was called to formalize our efforts and this led to the formation of Jamiatul Muslemeen of Ottawa-Carleton.
    
    A Shuraa was formed to lead the organization. In 1993, the Baptist Bible Church, located at 572 Moodie Dr. came up for sale. It was centrally located for the West End, the property was designated Institutional and there was, adjacent to the property, undeveloped tracts of land that had the potential for purchase and expansion in the future.
    
    We put in an offer through a Muslim Real Estate agent and after some negotiation; it was accepted by the Church.
    
    All praise belongs to our Lord and Creator Allah SWT, Who through His Mercy and Will, made it possible for the Shuraa to collect the entire purchase price and the property was bought for cash!!
    
    Initially, we cleaned out the Basement, put in a sub-floor, carpeted it and started the Masjid and Madrasa.`,

      The Islamic Society of Cumberland (Masjid Bilal) is a Registered Charitable community-oriented Muslim organization located in Canada’s Capital (Ottawa East, Orleans). Masjid Bilal which was established in 1993 to provide the Muslim community of Orleans with resources to meet religious and social needs with the objective of establishing a better relationship with the larger Canadian society. Masjid Bilal encourages and fosters excellent relationship building principles within a variety of community affiliations (City Councilors, Members of Parliament both Provincial and Federal, Law Enforcement officials, charitable organizations, etc.) in order to promote multicultural awareness and appreciation while representing the Muslims in Orleans as exemplary contributing members of society. Masjid Bilal has become a destination of choice not only for the Muslims of Orleans but also for the wider community of Ottawa East.

    By the grace of Allah, MAC Ottawa has initiated a new project aimed at serving the ever-expanding Muslim community in Ottawa, particularly in the south.
    
    We are pleased to announce a new Musallah serving the south end of Barrhaven, Manotick, and surrounding localities, located at 3971 Greenbank Road in the Half Moon Bay neighbourhood . The property is currently rented and is already open for daily prayers. The reception from the community around the new Musallah has been extremely positive, Alhamdulillah.
    
    We hope this Musallah will become the seed for a future community project to be planned on the 2.89 acres property. A purchase agreement for the property has been finalized with the closing date set to November 15th 2023. We are planning an inaugural fundraising and project presentation event on July 22nd 2023, during which more details about the project’s future vision will be shared inshaa Allah. We will share more information on the event once details are finalized.
    
    In the meantime, we request your dua’a for the success of this new initiative in serving our community, and its future growth and development. Kindly, please share this good news with others, especially those living near the new Musallah.
